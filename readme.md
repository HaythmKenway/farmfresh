_Farm Fresh aims to eradicate the system of middleman in the agriculture industry, we want farmers to directly sell their produce to the customers thereby enabling them to get right price for their produce and helping customers get fresh produce, with this in mind the initiative is undertaken by our team._

## How we will achieve it ?


_The whole process is fairly simple, the farmers who wish to sell have to sign-up on our platform and list their produce and the customer who need the produce buy them from our platform. We aim to make the demand and the supply meet, thereby giving the right to decide the price of the produce in the hands of the farmers._

## What do we deal with ?

_We term every farmer as producer, regardless of what they produce, we deal with any produce that a farmer wishes to sell starting from staple food of India rice and wheat to spices and pulses. We promote organic produce over others and firmly believe that nature in itself is a gift and we want the gift to be within reach for everyone._

## How customers can buy ?

_Customers can buy produce of their choice, they have to sign-up initially, then they can  buy the produce or add that to their cart and finally when the order is placed the produce will be delivered to them  through our logistics support._

##  Future Outlook

_Looking Forward we would like to make this initiative production ready and deploy this site in real world to explore the opportunities that this venture as to offer. We have immense trust in our team effort that we can achieve this goal in the shortest span of time possible._

## Conclusion
